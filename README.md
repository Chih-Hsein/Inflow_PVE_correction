# Inflow_PVE_correction
Matlab code for correcting inflow and partial volume effects in arterial input function (AIF) measured from DCE MRI.

# Introduction
This repository contains Matlab code to estimate the percieved pulse number (n) in blood proton and also the reconstruction of AIF with the estimated n. In this way, the inflow and partial volume effects could be simultaneously compensated. A dedicaded AIF could be determined for further DCE (or DSC) analysis.
